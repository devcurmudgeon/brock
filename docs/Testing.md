check_parsing
-------------

ybd aims to normalise definitions into a more understandable representation.
With the addition of _parse-only_ mode, ybd can dump this representation as
json, and we can confirm there is no unexpected data.

FIXME: identify at least one valid test-case here.

check_cache_keys
----------------

Since ybd 15.44, the cache-key algorithm appears stable and can be
applied to definitions as far back as baserock-14.40.

So we can use the cache-keys as checksums to avoid regressions in the
algorithm. This doesn't matter much for the cache-key algorithm itself,
since it is versioned, but checking that we can get to these values also
confirms that we can still parse the old definitions files themselves.

check splits
------------

We reduce the size of systems artifacts by installing a only subset of the
outputs from the builds during the assembly process. The code for this
is mainly in splitting.py, and involves applying regex expressions to the
artifacts, based on the definitions and default split-rules, during the
'install-stratum-artifacts' step.

For a given checkout of definitions, the generated files in a system should
be the same for all future versions of ybd, so we can checksum a known-good
list of generated files, and compare new runs against it as a regression test.

The best candidate is minimal-system, since this expressly makes use of a lot
of splitting. The proposed test case is from Richard Dale's original commit
of the split functionality…

But we should also test (say) devel-system…

The above was achieved on AWS.
